What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
By doing git init we create an empty repoistory on the local machine along with a hidden .git file which maintains the log. It tells us about the files that are being tracked and the files that are not being tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area lets you know if the file is being tracked. 


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By adding different files seperately to the staging area whenever they are ready and than commiting them from staging area to the repository to achieve one commit per logical change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When we want to develop an experimental feature we want to make sure that it works as expected before integrating it with the main code. By naming this branch appropriatley it helps us track back to the branch if there is any issue related to it
	When moving on to new work creating a branch is always helpful. It's like a context switch. It helps us keep the project organized. Branches are good to collbrate and if we find a bug we can simple switch that branch fix the bug and move on.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Diagrams helps us to know the flow of branches. It helps us to determine the reachable and unreachable branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	Merging 2 branches together results in merging the feature/fix branch into the master banch and hence commbining both the implementation to the main branch. It helps us to easily identify the reachable code and is easy to understand.
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
	Automatic merging may add unwanted/duplicate code or remove necessary code while doing it manually helps to make sure that we add the correct code and remove the unwanted code during the merge.
